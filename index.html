                <h4 class="descrip">One of the best public ground of jamshedpur to play all types of sports. There are no grass on field bt still is plain. It's a big ground. You can find all types people playing there in the morning and evening. It's also good ground for preparation of running for any defence jobs. There is parking too for vehicle. But always be careful about your gadgets. Don't leave them on ground or elsewhere as that might be stolen. I would say avoid taking any sorts of gadget there.For me personally this ground has been the playground of life in literal terms, since I was a kid. Now with time and pressure of being structurally developed our school Loyola has made a parking at one end of it. A good place to be around.

            <h4 class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 de">Jamshedpur's largest auditorium was inaugurated today by Tata Steel managing director T.V. Narendran on the premises of Loyola School in Bistupur.The three-storied air-conditioned Fasy Auditorium, named after the older one which was demolished in 2012 to make way for this, is one with world-class facilities, can seat 1,578, at least 170 more than Tata Auditorium.
Principal Father Sebastian Puthenpura maintained the auditorium would not be let out on commercial purposes, as they were a Jesuit organisation. "But any educational institution can approach the school managing committee to stage their functions," he explained.The new auditorium, spread over 2,953 sq metres, has been built at a cost of over Rs 6 crore. Construction started on December 1, 2012, and was completed a week ago.Apart from two green rooms on the second floor, the auditorium also has four special classrooms - for music, activity, reading and computer.A Calcutta-based company has installed a sophisticated sound system with separate equalisers for around eight amplifiers. Special microphones with ability to catch high-resolution sound have also been installed, besides special absorption and reflection panels for better acoustics.
